Experienced System Verification and Mechanical Engineer with a strong interest and expertise in surgical robotics. Used to employed at Medtronic, where I have been working since 2018. My work revolves around robot subsystem design and system accuracy optimization, specifically in the areas of ortho. and neuro. robotics. Eager to make disruptive innovations in the surgical robotics industry, I am pursuing a master's degree to enhance my knowledge of robotics and control systems.

During my tenure at Medtronic, I have gained invaluable experience and developed strong technical skills. Notably, I have been deeply involved in the Spine Robotics and Optical Navigation System project, where I have mastered spine robotics, trauma robotics, optical navigation system design, and remote support and consultation platform development. I have also filed Spine-Robotic Related Patents.

Driven by my passion for robotics research, I aspire to contribute to the development of surgical robotic innovations, particularly in the areas of robot sensing and perception, robot vision, navigation and positioning systems, and autonomous systems. My ultimate goal is to solve the shortage and uneven distribution of medical resources by inventing disruptive innovations and becoming a Subject Matter Expert in the industry.
