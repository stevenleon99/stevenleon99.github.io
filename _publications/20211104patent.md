excerpt: "This innovative and versatile energy-based device (EBD) integrates multiple functions [coagulation, cutting, irrigation, suction] into a single, comprehensive tool. Despite its multifunctionality, surgeons have expressed concerns regarding the cumbersome and repetitive task of cleaning tissue eschar. Typically, this requires removing the device from the abdomen, an extra step that not only prolongs the surgery but also risks injuring the patient through repeated contact with the abdominal wall. Additionally, such removal can lead to the loss of pneumoperitoneum. The distinctive feature of this innovation, setting it apart from conventional devices, lies in its design at the distal end of the electrode. Here, a specially designed valve and cleaning mechanism allow for in-situ cleaning of the eschar, eliminating the need to withdraw the device from the abdomen. This advancement significantly streamlines the surgical process, enhancing both efficiency and patient safety."

<p class="maintext1">A monopolar surgical apparatus, comprising: a control portion; a shaft lever extending from the control portion to the distal side along the longitudinal axis; and a monopolar assembly extending from the shaft lever to the distal side along the longitudinal axis. The monopolar assembly comprises: a tubular member, a valve member, and a monopolar electrode at least partially provided in the tubular member. The inner cavity of the tubular member comprises a cleaning portion configured to clean the monopolar electrode, and the monopolar electrode can perform a translational motion, along the longitudinal axis, between a retraction position where an electrode head retracts into the cleaning portion and an extension position where the electrode head extends from the tubular member to the distal side. When the monopolar electrode is located at the extension position, the valve member is open, and the control portion can control the monopolar electrode to execute a surgical operation. When the monopolar electrode is located at the retraction position, the valve member is closed, so that the distal end of the cleaning portion is sealed and a cleaning operation can be executed on the monopolar electrode in the cleaning portion .</p>
