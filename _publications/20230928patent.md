title: "UNIVERSAL ADAPTOR FOR AN IMAGING DEVICE AND CORRECTOR ASSEMBLY"
collection: publication
permalink: /publication/20230928patent
excerpt: "The image corrector, pivotal for implementing image distortion correction algorithms, is designed to be seamlessly integrated with specific C-arm devices. Its importance is particularly pronounced in the case of intensifier C-arms, which, unlike their flat-panel counterparts, are more prone to significant image distortion. A challenge, however, arises from the lack of uniform design standards across different C-arm models. To address this issue and ensure both appropriate and precise integration, a universal image corrector adapter has been meticulously developed. This adapter is tailored to accommodate the varying design specifications of C-arm devices, thereby ensuring optimal functionality and accuracy of the image correction process."

<p class="maintext1">An adaptor assembly comprising a plurality of spacers configured to contact a plurality of contact points of an imaging device and a plurality of holders configured to be adjustable in one or more directions and to support the plurality of spacers. The adaptor assembly is configured to couple a corrector assembly to an imaging device. The plurality of holders may comprise a bracket and at least one side bracket; a plurality of arms, each arm comprising a first link pivotably connected to a base and a second link pivotably connected to the first link; at least one clamp assembly; or at least one belt assembly.</p>
