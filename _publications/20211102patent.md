excerpt: "This innovation represents a significant advancement in energy-based medical devices (EBDs), specifically tailored for laparoscopic surgery applications. It's ingeniously designed to assist surgeons in two critical areas. Firstly, it provides an invaluable aid in accurately locating bleeding spots within blood ponds, a common challenge in the minimally invasive environment of laparoscopic procedures. Secondly, this device addresses the issue of surgical plume, a frequent obstacle to clear visualization during these surgeries. By effectively managing and reducing surgical plume, it ensures that surgeons maintain an unobstructed view of the surgical site, thereby enhancing both the safety and efficiency of the operation. This dual functionality marks a notable leap forward in surgical technology, offering tangible benefits in operative precision and patient outcomes."

<p class="maintext1">An electrosurgical system includes an electrosurgical instrument coupled to a gas control unit. The gas control unit supplies a preset flow rate of gas to the electrosurgical instrument for displacing surgical smoke and/or blood from a surgical site. A vent tube may be coupled to the gas control unit for regulating a pressure within the surgical site.</p>
